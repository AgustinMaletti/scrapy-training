=======================================

This unit describes how to deploy scrapy spiders to [Scrapy Cloud](http://app.scrapinghub.com) and how to leverage from this platform.

## Sample Spiders
1. A simple project to demonstrate deploy: [[p1_first_deploy](spiders/p1_first_deploy/)]
2. A project to deploy with dependencies: [[p2_dependencies](spiders/p2_dependencies/)]
3. A project to deploy with Python Scripts: [[p3_scripts](spiders/p3_scripts/)]



## Hands-on

#### 1. Reddit Crawler
Create a crawler to fetch the 100 hottest submissions from reddit.com/r/programming (to run on Scrapy Cloud).


#### 2. Ranking submissions
Create a CLI app to fetch the scraped data from Scrapy Cloud and list the top 10 submissions from the latest crawl, based on the score below:

    new_score = S * C * K

        S → current score on reddit
        C → number of comments
        K → original poster's comments karma
