Unit 3: Running Spiders in the Cloud
=======================================

This unit describes how to deploy scrapy spiders to [Scrapy Cloud](http://app.scrapinghub.com) and how to leverage from this platform.

## Sample Spiders
1. A simple project to demonstrate deploy: [`p1_first_deploy`](spiders/p1_first_deploy/)
2. A project to deploy with dependencies: [`p2_dependencies`](spiders/p2_dependencies/)
3. A project to deploy with Python Scripts: [`p3_scripts`](spiders/p3_scripts/)


## Hands-on

#### 1. Deploy the books crawler
Deploy the crawler for books.toscrape.com built in [unit 2](../unit2) to Scrapy Cloud.

a. Run the spider without touching any settings
b. Run the spider, but now with `DOWNLOAD_DELAY = 1` set via web UI

[Check out the project **once you're done**.](spiders/p4_bookscrawler/)


#### 2. Reddit Ranker
Create a crawler to fetch the 100 hottest submissions from reddit.com/r/programming (to run on Scrapy Cloud).

After that, create a CLI app to fetch the scraped data from Scrapy Cloud and list the top 10 submissions from the latest crawl, based on the score below:

    new_score = S * C * K

        S → current score on reddit
        C → number of comments
        K → original poster's comments karma
